  - `Region`, `Segment`, `Country`, `City`
  - `Category`, `Sub-Category`
  - `Sales`, `Profit`, `Quantity`, `Discount`

 Tools Used

- Power BI Desktop – for creating interactive dashboards and reports
- Microsoft Excel / Python (optional) – for initial data cleaning (already done)

Dashboard Visuals

The Power BI report (`SALESSS.pbix`) includes the following visuals:
